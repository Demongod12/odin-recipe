This project is a simple HTML-based recipe webpage. 
By completing this project, Iâ€™ll create a basic webpage to display a recipe, showcasing core HTML tags and elements like headings, lists, images, and links. This project will help me practice HTML structure, layout, and basic content formatting, providing a solid foundation for future web development projects.
